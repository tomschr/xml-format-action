 <para> RPM (RPM Package Manager) is used for managing software packages. Its main commands are <command>rpm</command> and <command>rpmbuild</command>. The powerful RPM database can be queried by the users, system administrators and package builders for detailed information about the installed software.  </para>
 <para>
  <command>rpm</command> has five modes: installing, uninstalling (or updating)
  software packages, rebuilding the RPM database, querying RPM bases or
  individual RPM archives, integrity checking of packages and signing packages.
  <command>rpmbuild</command> can be used to build installable packages from
  pristine sources.  </para>
 <para>
  Installable RPM archives are packed in a special binary format. These
  archives consist of the program files to install and certain meta information
  used during the installation by <command>rpm</command> to configure the
  software package or stored in the RPM database for documentation purposes.
  RPM archives normally have the extension <filename>.rpm</filename>.

 <tip><title>Software Development Packages</title><para>
   For several packages, the components needed for software development
   (libraries, headers, include files, etc.) have been put into separate
   packages. These development packages are only needed if you want to compile
   software yourself (for example, the most recent &gnome; packages). They can
   be identified by the name extension <literal>-devel</literal>, such as the
   packages <systemitem class="resource">alsa-devel</systemitem> and
   <systemitem class="resource">gimp-devel</systemitem>.
